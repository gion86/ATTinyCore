Arduino-Tiny is an open source set of ATtiny "cores" for the Arduino platform.

The Arduino platform currently supports Atmel ATmega processors. There is a need
for the Arduino platform to work with physically smaller DIP package processors.
The intent of this project is fulfill that need. Specifically, our goal is to
provide a core that enables Arduino users to work with the ATtiny84 (84/44/24),
ATtiny85 (85/45/25), and ATtiny2313 processors.
